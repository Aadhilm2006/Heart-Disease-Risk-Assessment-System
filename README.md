# Heart-Disease-Risk-Assessment-System
This project is a Heart Disease Risk Assessment System developed using Java and Java Swing GUI that implements a rule-based clinical decision support tool for predicting cardiovascular disease risk. The system features a user-friendly graphical interface built with Java Swing that collects 13 patient parameters including demographics (age, sex), clinical measurements (chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG, maximum heart rate), and exercise test results (exercise-induced angina, ST depression, ST slope, number of major vessels, and thalassemia type) through interactive input forms with real-time validation. Using predefined medical risk calculation algorithms such as the Framingham Risk Score or point-based scoring systems, the application processes user inputs through conditional logic and mathematical formulas to compute cardiovascular disease risk scores and classifications. The system displays prediction results, feature analysis showing which factors contributed to the risk assessment, and transparency information explaining the scoring methodology, all within a professional Java Swing interface with organized panels for data entry, risk calculation, and results visualization.
